Generic Module (module for Omeka S)
===================================


> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__


[Generic Module] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to manage all common one
time tasks (install, config, settings management…) from the config of another
module, so it avoids the developer to copy-paste common code between modules.

Internally, the logic is "config over code": so all settings have just to be set
in the main `config/module.config.php` file, inside a key with the lowercase
module name, with sub-keys `config`, `settings`, `site_settings`, `user_settings`
and `block_settings`. All the forms have just to be standard Zend/Laminas forms.
Eventual install and uninstall sql can be set in `data/install/` and upgrade
code in `data/scripts`. Another class allows to check and install resources
(vocabulary, resource templates, custom vocab, etc.).

**Warning**: The module Generic was replaced by modules [Common] and [Easy Admin]
and kept only for compatibility until next Omeka S major version.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename module folder `Generic`.

Unlike other modules, this one is available once unzipped, even if it is not
installed or not enabled in the admin modules panel.


Usage (for developer)
---------------------

For new modules, use module [Common].

### Main Usage

This module contains a generic abstract class `AbstractModule`, that extends
itself the Omeka one, so make your module extends it.

Replace the following:

```php
namespace MyModule;
use Omeka\Module\AbstractModule;
class Module extends AbstractModule
{}
```

with:

```php
namespace MyModule;
require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/Generic/AbstractModule.php';
use Generic\AbstractModule;
class Module extends AbstractModule
{
    const NAMESPACE = __NAMESPACE__;
}
```

If you prefer not to force install of module Generic, you can copy the file `Generic/AbstractModule.php`
in folder `src/` of your module, then require it like that:

```php
namespace MyModule;
if (!class_exists(\Generic\AbstractModule::class)) {
    require file_exists(dirname(__DIR__) . '/Generic/AbstractModule.php')
        ? dirname(__DIR__) . '/Generic/AbstractModule.php'
        : __DIR__ . '/src/Generic/AbstractModule.php';
}
use Generic\AbstractModule;
class Module extends AbstractModule
{
    const NAMESPACE = __NAMESPACE__;
}
```

### Installing resources

To install resources, you need to include the file `InstallResources.php`. The
files that contains vocabs, custom vocabs, and templates inside `data/` will be
automatically imported.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
